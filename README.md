The program below presents the Koch curve (a curve of infinite length bounding a finite area and admitting no tangent at any point of it and Hausdorff dimension, a geometric object that has no integer dimension) for generating a graph using iterative transformations.
The code generates a geometric model using iterative transformations based on the angles specified in the matrix q and plots the resulting points to create the final model. The number of iterations and the angles used determine the specific shape of the model.
Explanation:
clear all: This command clears all existing variables from the workspace.

k = 3;: This sets the variable k to 3, which represents the number of iterations or steps to perform for generating the pattern.

q = [0, pi/3, -pi/3, 0];: This defines an array q containing four angles: 0, π/3, -π/3, and 0. These angles are used in the iterative process to determine how points are transformed.

n = 4^k;: This calculates the value of n as 4 raised to the power of k. It represents the number of points that will be plotted.

W2 = zeros(k, n);: This initializes a matrix W2 with dimensions k by n filled with zeros. This matrix will store the intermediate values during the iteration.

W2(1, :) = reshape(repmat(q, 1, 4^(k-1)), n, 1);: This line computes the first row of the W2 matrix. It starts by repeating the q array 4^(k-1) times horizontally using repmat. Then, it reshapes the result into a column vector and assigns it to the first row of W2.

The following for loop is used to compute the subsequent rows of the W2 matrix. It iterates from i = 2 to k.

W2(i, :) = reshape(repmat(q, 4^(i-1), 4^(k-i)), n, 1);: For each i, this line repeats the q array different numbers of times depending on the iteration and reshapes it into a column vector. These values are stored in the i-th row of W2.
W = sum(W2);: This line calculates the sum of each column in the W2 matrix and stores the result in the W array.

x0 = 0; and y0 = 0;: These lines set the initial coordinates (x0 and y0) to 0, which is where the drawing will start.

The next for loop iterates over the elements of the W array to compute the x and y coordinates of each point in the pattern based on the angles specified in W. It uses trigonometric functions (cosine and sine) to update the x and y coordinates.

line(x, y): This command plots the points specified by the x and y arrays to create the fractal-like pattern.

axis equal: This ensures that the x and y axes are scaled equally, so the resulting plot looks like a proper geometric shape.
